Hi!...

The Refactor or migration of Angular version 1 to version 2 or 4 or 5 is not possible.

we need to recreate a the application from angular 1 to other upgraded version.

I just reformed the structure by the past angular-1 version code.

Thanks,
Lional. J.

Steps to see the output:

1) Clone the repo https://github.com/wapappdeveloper/Refactor.git

2) navigate to the folder.

3) Open cmd or GIT Bash Window.

4) npm install

5) ng serve --open
